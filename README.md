# hello-world

I've recently taken up knitting, but all I do is make rectangles. I could learn more, but first I want to make a scarf for everybody I know. Scarf making is just relaxing and doesn't require a lot of thinking or attention. I do it while watching tv and it takes away any need for fidgeting, while also creating something to keep my friends warm and cozy for the upcoming winter.
